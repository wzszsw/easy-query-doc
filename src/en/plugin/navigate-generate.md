# Quick Generate Navigation Properties
Step 1: Inside the entity class, enter `nav2...` to pop up the corresponding navigation property creation UI.

<img :src="$withBase('/images/navigate2.jpg')">


Step 2: Set the relationship type (one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many, etc.).
<img :src="$withBase('/images/navigate-ui.jpg')">

After selecting the corresponding relationship keys, click confirm and the plugin will automatically generate strongly-typed properties, Lombok properties, or strings.

Of course, you can also manually write the relationship.
