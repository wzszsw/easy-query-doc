# DSL Operator Hints

As we all know, in Easy Query's relational operators, `>` is the `gt` method, and `<` is the `lt` method.
You don't need to memorize these symbols specifically. The Easy Query plugin thoughtfully provides hints for these relational operators.
We can directly use hints for `>`, `<`, and other relational operators, and the plugin will automatically replace them with the corresponding method names.
